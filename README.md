# Project: Our Friendship Bible Study

This is the GitHub repository for the project you named "OFBS-2-0", generated from the "yaxt-tinysites-basic" website template at [yax.com](https://yax.com).

From here, deploy your website for free hosting. Just click a button to deploy your website to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Render.com](https://render.com/). During the process, you will create a second repo for deployment. Name it what you like; I suggest "OFBS-2-0-deploy".

# Tiny Site: Basic.css

This is a one page "tiny site" built using the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

The page is styled with the [Basic.css](https://vladocar.github.io/Basic.css/) stylesheet by [Vladimir Carrer](http://www.vcarrer.com/). This stylesheet makes simple grids and cards with only HTML5 tags.

## Using the on-page editor

You can edit the page using the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) on-page editor. Use the link `https://example.com/index.html?login` to open the edit toolbar. Click "Edit" in the toolbar to begin editing.
